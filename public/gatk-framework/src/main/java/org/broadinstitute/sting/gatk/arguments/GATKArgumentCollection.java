     *  A PED file must have 1 and only 1 phenotype in the sixth column. The phenotype can be either a
     *  quantitative trait or an affection status column: GATK will automatically detect which type
     *  (i.e. based on whether a value other than 0, 1, 2 or the missing genotype code is observed).</p>
     *
     *  <p>If an individual's sex is unknown, then any character other than 1 or 2 can be used.</p>
     *
     *  <p>You can add a comment to a PED or MAP file by starting the line with a # character. The rest of that
     *  line will be ignored. Do not start any family IDs with this character therefore.</p>
     *
     *  <p>Affection status should be coded:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *  <li>-9 missing</li>
     *   <li>0 missing</li>
     *   <li>1 unaffected</li>
     *   <li>2 affected</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If any value outside of -9,0,1,2 is detected than the samples are assumed
     * to phenotype values are interpreted as string phenotype values.  In this case -9 uniquely
     * represents the missing value.</p>
     *
     * <p>Genotypes (column 7 onwards) cannot be specified to the GATK.</p>
     *
     * <p>For example, here are two individuals (one row = one person):</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *   FAM001  1  0 0  1  2
     *   FAM001  2  0 0  1  2
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Each -ped argument can be tagged with NO_FAMILY_ID, NO_PARENTS, NO_SEX, NO_PHENOTYPE to
     * tell the GATK PED parser that the corresponding fields are missing from the ped file.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that most GATK walkers do not use pedigree information.  Walkers that require pedigree
     * data should clearly indicate so in their arguments and will throw errors if required pedigree
     * information is missing.</p>
